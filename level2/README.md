# Level 2

To be as competitive as possible, we decide to have a decreasing pricing for longer rentals.

New rules:

- price per day decreases by 10% after 1 day
- price per day decreases by 30% after 4 days
- price per day decreases by 50% after 10 days

Adapt the rental price computation to take these new rules into account.
